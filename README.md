# Test-a-perceptual-phenomenon

# Project Overview

In this project, I investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect and create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task myself. i then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpret my results in terms of hypotheses.
# Why this Project
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations.
This project is focused on statistics, including designing an experiment and testing a hypothesis. Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a data analyst's work.
# Areas of Statisics
This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:
* How to identify components of an experiment
* How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
* How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
